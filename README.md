# Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic-Dataset

The sinking of the RMS Titanic in the early morning of 15 April 1912, four days into the ship's maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City, was one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history, killing more than 1,500 people.
The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic.

The ship had received six warnings of sea ice but was travelling at near maximum speed when the lookouts sighted the iceberg.
Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled the starboard (right) side and opened five of sixteen compartments to the sea.
The disaster caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the unequal treatment of the three passenger classes during the evacuation.

# Problem Satement :
On April 15, 1912, the largest passenger liner ever made collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage.
When the Titanic sank it killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
One of the reasons that the shipwreck resulted in such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
